##### AthenaHealth · 2023
### Encouraging Prompt Medical Bill Payment 

In the summer of 2023, I joined <a href="https://www.athenahealth.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>AthenaHealth</em></a> as a UX Design Intern, working closely with design, product, engineering to develop a new platform within their healthcare software suite.

One of AthenaHealth’s core offerings is medical billing — enabling healthcare providers to charge for their services and allowing insurers and patients to make payments through its cloud-based system.

By 2023, the growing number of **outstanding medical bill**s had become a pressing issue. As the company prepared to launch a dedicated billing portal, I explored ways to nudge users toward more timely payments.

I focused on improving how the system guides payer actions at critical decision points — clarifying what to do, when, and why.

<div className="w-screen relative left-1/2 right-1/2 -ml-[50vw] -mr-[50vw] my-20">
  <LabelIndicatorCarousel
    showIndicators={false}
    renderCaption={({ caption }) => (
      <div className="text-center text-stone-600 dark:text-stone-300 text-xs sm:text-sm mt-2 sm:mt-3 md:mt-5" style={{ fontFamily: 'Inter var' }}>
        {caption && (
          <span dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: caption }} />
        )}
      </div>
    )}
    items={[
      { 
        label: "", 
        caption: "Color-coded status tags indicating invoice urgency <sup>1</sup>",
        imageUrl: "https://f5uskgwhyu2fi170.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/athena-1.jpg" 
      },
      { 
        label: "", 
        caption: "Chat-based communication for faster claim resolution <sup>2</sup>",
        imageUrl: "https://f5uskgwhyu2fi170.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/athena-2.jpg"
      },
    ]}
  />
</div>

This includes <sup>1</sup> highlighting invoice urgency to help users quickly identify pending or overdue bills, and <sup>2</sup> introducing messenger for payment adjudication communication.

3 months wasn’t enough to ship and see the full impact of my work in such a complex, compliance-heavy domain like healthcare. However, after the portal launched in 2024 alongside other new features, AthenaHealth saw a **30%** reduction in client payment cycles.

I'm genuinely grateful to my mentors at Athenahealth — <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertreimann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Robert</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/julie-marquis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Julie</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marco-milea-a7050850/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marco</a> — for their warm onboarding and thoughtful guidance throughout this project.
