### Encouraging prompt medical bill payment 

In the summer of 2023, I joined [*AthenaHealth*](https://www.athenahealth.com/) as a UX Design Intern, working closely with design, product, engineering to develop a new platform within their healthcare software suite.

One of AthenaHealth’s core offerings is medical billing — enabling healthcare providers to charge for their services and allowing insurers and patients to make payments through its cloud-based system.

By 2023, the growing number of **outstanding medical bill**s had become a pressing issue. As the company prepared to launch a dedicated billing portal, I explored ways to nudge users toward more timely payments.

I focused on improving how the system guides payer actions at critical decision points — clarifying what to do, when, and why.

    items={[
      { 
        label: "", 
        caption: "Color-coded status tags indicating invoice urgency",
        imageUrl: "https://f5uskgwhyu2fi170.public.blob.vercel-storage.com/athena-1.jpg" 
      },
      { 
        label: "",

      },
    ]}
  />

This includes [1] highlighting invoice urgency to help users quickly identify pending or overdue bills, and [2] introducing messenger for payment adjudication communication.

3 months wasn’t enough to ship and see the full impact of my work in such a complex, compliance-heavy domain like healthcare. However, after the portal launched in 2024 alongside other new features, AthenaHealth saw a **30%** reduction in client payment cycles.
